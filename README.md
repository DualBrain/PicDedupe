* This Demo is completely written in VB. It doesn't use any P/Invokes and it does not fall back to C# libs.
* A Framework Version and a .NET 5 Version share the same class libraries, and have the same exact same Form's code, but show the display and performance differences between both versions. Which are significant. Please explore yourselves! 
* The App demonstrates how to use multitargeted Class Libraries in VB for easyand risk-free  Migration purposes.
* This demo app also shows how to easily use almost the whole set of UWP APIs within Visual Basic (>.NET 5) WinForms Apps.
